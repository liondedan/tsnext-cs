  feature_1: `The Pembrokeshire Coast National park has been voted best coastline in the world with incredible sunsets and unhindered views of the night sky. Each pitch has their own fireput making our campsite perfect for stargazing after watching the sun set into the sea at Abereiddy.

  An ideal and tranquil base for viewing the attractions of Pembrokeshire and only a few miles from the shops, pubs and restaurants of St Davids.

If you are looking for a hi-tech holiday park then we are probably not for you. But if you want your children to know how to build a den or forage for blackberries, then our Pembrokeshire camping site will be exactly what you’re looking for.`,
  feature_2: `Our campsite is on on the Western tip of the Pembrokeshire Peninsula in West Wales. We are located less than a mile from Aberiddy beach and the famous Blue Lagoon, host of the Red Bull Cliff Diving Championships. The popular fishing village of Porthgain is also just a mile away and features the award winning ‘Shed’ bistro restaurant and ‘The Sloop Inn’ family pub.

 

We are also just five miles from St Davids, the smallest city in Britain, with its wealth of restaurants, local shops and the famous St Davids Cathedral – a site of pilgrimage and worship for more than 800 years.

 

In the opposite direction we are six miles from Fishguard and the harbour of Goodwich, also the location of the Irish ferry crossing.

  feature_3: `A frequent bus service stops directly outside the campsite and runs to and from St Davids, Fishguard and Haverfordwest. This makes it the perfect base for walkers and hikers of the Pembrokeshire Coastal National Paths. Our pitches overlook a natural valley that leads to the sea, which provides a beautiful walk all the way to Abereiddy beach and the coastal path. Bring your bikes and enjoy miles of backroads and wilderness. There are handfuls of back road routes to discover, most of which end up at a blue flag awarded beach.

 

If you’ve brought along a canoe or two, or even a boat, these can be launched at Abereiddy or a mile down the road at Porthgain. There is some great coastline to be discovered including untouched beaches which can only be accessed via the sea.

 

The Pembrokeshire coast has some great adventure activities to offer, including, surfing and coasteering. Check out our pembrokeshire activities page for more details.`,
